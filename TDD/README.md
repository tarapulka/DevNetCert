**Task**: develop a script that extracts customer data from a router configuration. The script should parse customer data, such as customer name, customer VLAN, and customer IP address, and return the data in the JSON format.

Sample router configuration is present in _config.txt_ located at the same folder than a script.


To create a script. let us do it in iterations:
1. Parse Customer Names
2. Parse Customer IP Addresses
3. Parse Customer VLANs
4. Group All Together
